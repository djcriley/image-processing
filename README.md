# image-processing
This is an canny edge detector image processing project using C and parallel processing libraries like MPI, Cuda, Open MP

## Documentation
Each folder contains a different method to parallelize the serial implementation of the canny edge detector algorithm that was developed. Inside each folder is the parallelized canny edge detector, the serial implementation and the numbers that were calculated using timing functions within the code.
